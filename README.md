# AdClick Predictor: Logistic-Regression-Project


# Description: Predicting Advertisement Clicks Using User Data

The goal of this project is to analyze a synthetic advertising dataset to determine the likelihood of an internet user clicking on an advertisement. We will develop a predictive model to forecast ad clicks based on various user features, including demographics, browsing behavior, and past interactions with advertisements. By leveraging this data, we aim to uncover patterns and insights that can improve ad targeting and increase engagement rates. The ultimate objective is to enhance the effectiveness of online advertising campaigns through data-driven decision-making.
